# homelab

Inspired by [makerun/nerdbox](https://gitlab.com/makerun/nerdbox) , my [homelab](homelab.md) hosts a number of tools used for my personal learning and re-learning of things I used to have more time to do.

* [homelab.md](homelab.md) lists details of the hardware, and some lessons learned during its build.
* [os.md](os.md) list details of the operating system install (Ubuntu Desktop) and tuning.
* [lab_setup_notes](lab_setup_notes) a random collection of links for tools set up.
